            Before examing why caring whether you love the person you love more than they love you hurts your relationships more than it helps, I want to outline what I think love is, and what it is not.
            <br><br>
            I used to have a very patient and kind therapist. She was happily married for over 20 years to a man she admittedly manifested by simply listing off the traits she would love in a man, and waiting to receive him. He ticked all her boxes.
            <br><br>
            I constantly complained to her about my dating life and interpersonal relationships in general. A reoccuring question she would ask me was "Do you believe love is meant to be transactional?" I would always answer no I didn't. But the question persisted of weeks, months, and years. And I finally realized what she meant. I did in fact believe love was transactional. I believed other people were like little vending machines. If I put in the right amount of money, what I want would come out of it. And in an ideal world, I suppose love would really work that way. You treat someone the way you want them to treat you, and they return the same love. 
            <br><br>
            The thing is, everyone is a unique human with their own desires, behaviors, pasts, and upbringings. This is why I also love the concept of love languages: the way you love is not necessarily the way your partner loves. And to expect that is not only small minded, it can also lead to toxic behaviors very fast because you believe you are not getting the treatment you "should" be receiving.
