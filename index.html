            <h2>Expressing myself through art and words is my main priority of my blog. It's vital for me to be able to process my emotions, abstract ideas, and overall being in a tangible way in the 4d plane.</h2>

            2022 has been a very transformative year for me. I am reaping the benefits of previous years of shadow work, manifestation, inner child work, mindset shifting, and overall healing. Click the button below to view my best works from 2022.

            2021 was a year of self discovery. I went back into my past to find events which lead to me being who I was at the time. Some of the traits were unfavorable and holding me back from my highest self. Through art and journaling I was able to identify these traits and tame them.

            2020 was one of the hardest years of my adult life. I had a lot of interpersonal relationships that I ruined due to unexaminaed limiting beliefs. I am still grateful for this time though, as some pretty cool art came from it.
